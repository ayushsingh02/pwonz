                <p>Something has always existed. According to physics, there can never be true physical
                    nothingness—though there can be times when existence resembles nothing, such as a vacuum (the state
                    of minimum possible energy) (Phys.org). Creating a space where there are no quantum fluctuations
                    requires an enormous amount of energy, and there would be a remnant of that energy in that space
                    afterwards if the fluctuations were flushed out, plus an unstable environment (1veritasium). Even on
                    computers, deleted data is not actually tossed away, by rather written over. The fact that there can
                    never be nothingness means the universe, and anything possibly beyond it, is eternal, as something
                    has always been around. Whatever we consider to be before the Big Bang—God, the universe in
                    infinitesimal form, or both—one thing is certain: it was there. <br><br>
                    Consider that for a moment: everything we see around us is assumed to have had a cause and is
                    contingent upon something else. However, when it comes to existence itself, it takes on the
                    opposite. It’s mind boggling to think that something has always been and always will be. It goes
                    contrary to what we experience in our lives. But somehow, it’s possible. It also implies that cause
                    is a misnomer: if existence is eternal, then cause is not all that important. Existence, without a
                    beginning or end, continues to change its form. In addition, the concept of time has to be thrown
                    out as well if we consider the nature of the universe. Without a beginning or end to existence, time
                    is rendered irrelevant. Sure, it is a useful tool in our daily lives, but it is not a universal
                    fact. Time is just our perception of duration within an eternal universe. <br><br>
                    A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing
                    information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the
                    web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the
                    user's device. A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often
                    confused. For a user, a search engine is just a website that provides links to other websites.
                    However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser
                    installed. Web browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and
                    smartphones. In 2019, an estimated 4.3 billion people used a browser. The most used browser is
                    Google Chrome, with a 64% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 18%. Other
                    notable browsers include Firefox and Microsoft Edge. The purpose of a web browser is to fetch
                    information resources from the Web and display them on a user's device. This process begins when the
                    user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser.
                    Virtually all URLs on the Web start with either http: or https: which means the browser will
                    retrieve them with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In the case of https:, the communication
                    between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of security and privacy. Once a
                    web page has been retrieved, the browser's rendering engine displays it on the user's device. This
                    includes image and video formats supported by the browser. Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to
                    other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser
                    navigates to the new resource. Thus the process of bringing content to the user begins again. Most
                    browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits
                    to the same page. The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be
                    downloaded from the server again. Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server
                    stipulates in its HTTP response messages.

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The finance highlights the supposed discrepancy by comparing its figures for the super-rich with
                    those of the median American household earning $70,000 a year and paying 14 per cent in federal
                    taxes. The message: Look at how “unfair” the American tax system has become. The ultra-rich are
                    subject to different laws from everyone else. But is that really the case? Let’s say you own a house
                    that increases in value from €1 million ($1.19 million) to €1.5 million within four years. How much
                    income tax do you have to pay on the increase? In Germany, at least, zero. And that’s how the system
                    works in most countries. You don’t have to pay income taxes on unrealized gains, but on realized
                    gains. The same principle applies to stocks: If stock prices go up, but you don’t sell your stocks,
                    you don’t have to pay taxes. You pay taxes when you sell your shares or your house, i.e. when the
                    unrealized gains become realized profits. Conversely, if you make unrealized losses, i.e. if the
                    value of your house goes down, you don’t get a refund from the tax authorities, i.e. you cannot
                    claim these unrealized losses, which only exist on paper, to reduce your tax liability. ProPublica
                    has compared apples and oranges: The growth in the worth of the 25 richest Americans estimated by
                    Forbes primarily derives from an increase in the value of their assets, such as stocks and property.
                    Jeff Bezos’ wealth, for example, has grown because the value of Amazon stock increased. Warren
                    Buffett’s fortune grew as the stock he holds in his company, Berkshire Hathaway, gained value.
                    ProPublica compares the increase in wealth, which primarily derives from (unrealized) stock gains,
                    to income taxes, which, in contrast, are levied on a very different tax base. And not just on the
                    super-rich, but on everyone. Or when was the last time you paid income taxes because your house was
                    worth more on paper than it was a year earlier? For ProPublica, this so-called “true tax rate” is
                    evidence of “loopholes” for the ultra-wealthy. What would happen if you, I or the super-rich had to
                    pay income taxes on unrealized capital gains? What would have happened in 2001 or 2008/2009 when
                    share prices dropped off a cliff? The state would have had to issue tax refunds to cover the
                    substantial share price losses. Most journalists have not asked these critical questions because the
                    fake figures fit their existing prejudices about the rich. GAM Investments, the Switzerland-listed
                    firm, has appointed Nick Tan and Ian Walker as director, business development. Their appointments
                    follow the promotion of Peter Mostarac, who joined GAM in 2011, as head of North America. Tan and
                    Walker will be based in New York and Chicago, respectively, and will report to Mostarac. Tan
                    previously worked at Conning, where he was a consultant relations manager, responsible for managing
                    relationships with global and regional investment consultants and outsourced chief investment
                    officer providers. Prior to Conning, he was an institutional sales associate at Aegon Asset
                    Management and a senior investment analyst at Willis Towers Watson. Walker has joined GAM from
                    Calamos Investments, where he spent 11 years. He was most recently director of consultant relations,
                    responsible for business development and relationship management with global and regional investment
                    consultants. He joined the firm initially in 2010 as a client service representative, before
                    becoming an investment consultant for three years. GAM employed 652 full-time-equivalent staff in 15
                    countries with investment centres in London, Cambridge, Zurich, Hong Kong, New York, Milan and
                    Lugano as at June 30, 2021. It has AuM of SFr126.0 billion ($136.3 billion).
